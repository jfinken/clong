## Usage

One issue is that I need to connect to a remote Postgresql 8.4 database
via a tunnel, with: 

    psql -h localhost process earthuser

However if I have Postgresql 9.1 server installed and running, this won't work.
Until a better solution presents itself, as the postgres user stop the local 
9.1 server via:
    
    /etc/init.d/postgres [start|stop] 

This allows the usage of psql over the tunnel as:

    psql -h localhost -p 5432 process earthuser
